## Anonymous personal QnA board written in rust + htmx

I wrote this app to test the viability of htmx and my own library [SmallUID](https://github.com/al-ula/small_uid), which used for IDs including the board url.

As always, I used tailwindcss with daisyui for styling.

There's a dockerfile for ease of deployment, though I haven't included the compilation process.
